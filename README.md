> Here are ways to do so:
1. To keep focused on studying,  a quiet study space is a better choice to study well.
2. During class, you may do an advance reading on the subject so that we will be able to participate.
3. Having a study circle can also help since you can share the experience with another person.
4. It is also better to play classical music while studying.
